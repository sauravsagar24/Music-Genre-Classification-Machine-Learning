# Music-Genre-Classification-Machine-Learning
Music has been known to humans since the beginning
of time. Since the melody of instruments fell on the ears
of humans, it has planted the seeds of emotions that would
otherwise be hard to accomplish. While music is ultimately
a melody that connects all hearts in this world, there are
additional classifications of music that bring music lovers
together and keep the melody going.
Classification of music into different categories is a concept
that allows the general public to distinguish between two
categories of music audio based on their composition and the
beats they contain. Music genre classification has recently
become a very popular concept as more and more genres
emerge around the world. From K-Pop to Classical, music
fans rely on music genre classification technology to listen
to songs based on their preferences. While it only takes a
click for a listener to switch from Hip-Hop to Rap, there is
undoubtedly much more beneath the surface that fuels our
passion for music.
The classification of musical genres is one of the common
problems in the study of music. Classification of music
based on genre helps in ordering the huge amount of music
that is created and consumed around the world.
